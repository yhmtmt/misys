# Lecture: Maritime Information System (MISYS)
Here the source codes produced in the lecture. Students can download and use the codes uploaded freely.
* AIS001 includes "main.cpp" which loads a text file "0307.txt" records AIVDM sentences. The file "0307.txt" cannot be provided as the open access material. You need to get it in the lecture.
* AIS002 includes "main.cpp" which shows a way to extract AIVDM sentences.
* AIS003 includes "main.cpp" which splits the AIVDM sentence into fields and removes the armoring of the 6th field. "main_rev.cpp" is the refactored version.
